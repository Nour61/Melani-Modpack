### Utility (Optional)

- [Falling Leaves](https://modrinth.com/mod/fallingleaves) [![FallingLeaves](https://img.shields.io/badge/-%E2%86%93-brightgreen)](https://github.com/RandomMcSomethin/fallingleaves/suites/2409365867/artifacts/51323158) - Pretty leaves falling from leaves, a very nice touch to worlds.

## Java & JVM Flags

A particularly crucial step, here is how-to:

**Installing the latest Java version**
- Step 1: Download Java 16 from https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk16-binaries/releases/download/jdk-16%2B36/OpenJDK16-jre_x64_windows_hotspot_16_36.msi
- Step 2: Run the installer and complete it
- Step 3: Now open the Minecraft launcher and edit your Fabric profile
- Step 4: Select below "More options"
- Step 5: See Java Executable and click on browse
- Step 6: Now find the file javaw in the following directory: C:\Program Files\AdoptOpenJDK\jre-16.0.0.36-hotspot\bin
- Step 7: Select the file and click on save
- Step 8: And you are done, should give a solid improvement in stability and performance

‚ö†Ô∏è *Please note some mods tend to break on the latest, all the mods from my modpack will work with it but if it does not work with any of your own added mods try Java 11 instead.*

**JVM Flags**
- Coming soon, this is something i myself haven't fully figured out. Default is good enough in most use cases.
- For now this should be a good read: https://gist.github.com/jellysquid3/8a7b21e57f47f5711eb5697e282e502e

## Optional steps

Still low on FPS? This corner is reserved for the perfectionist or the one on a low budget. (Still a work-in-progress, feel free to PR any tips for performance üòâ)

**Clean up your machine**
- Remove anything unwanted and kill everything that is running, pretty straight forward right.
- Physically clean your PC! Remove any dust or other foreign items from inside and make sure it has good airflow.
